Welcome to our CLI documentation!

The cedana CLI serves as the interface to our managed service, allowing you to deploy, inspect and manage workloads. We use Kueue extensively in the background to effectively schedule workloads, while running our Kubernetes controller in the background to seamlessly rebalance your HPC, ML or otherwise computation-heavy workloads with no interruptions. 

For detailed documentation on installing our managed Kubernetes or the larger Cedana ecosystem, please see [here](https://docs.cedana.ai).

### Quick start
