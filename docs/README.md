Here, you will find information on running the Cedana CLI on your machine. Note that Cedana CLI is different compared to the Cedana Daemon CLI.

Cedana CLI allows you to interact with your managed resources and perform operations such as create, delete and list on them. You will be able to schedule your workloads on demand and view them on kubernetes. We do this by making requests to the Cedana URL.

For detailed documentation on our managed Kubernetes or the larger Cedana system, please see [here](https://docs.cedana.ai).

### Quick start

First, ensure that you have Cedana CLI installed on your machine. See [installation](get-started/installation.md).
